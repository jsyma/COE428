Requirement 1: 
Suppose that towers (5,2,3) is invoked.
1. towers(4,2,1)
2. 18 recursive calls to towers() will be made before the first recursive call actually returns to the initial 	   invocation
3. stdout: 2 3 --> The first move is from Tower 2  to Tower 3 (First move by towers(1,2,3))
4. towers(0,3,3)

Suppose that towers(8,1,2) is invoked. How many lines will be printed to stdout?
- 255 lines will be printed to stdout


README Lab Submission 
1. A breif description of what you did (and did not) achieve in this Lab
	
I think I achieved all the bugs and improper inputs that could happen in this problem, for the executable command line code, I used gcc -o testTowers towersMain.c towers.c, exit(1) occurs when there are more than 3 arguments, when there are 2 arguements, when from and dest are the same location and also when from and dest are greater than 3.
